Hi po sir, nakita/nakuha na po namin yung bug. NASA LOGIN.HTML PALA PO SIR [Crying emoji],
kala namin po sir nasa login.js siya, 'yon pala nasa html lang pala huhu.
Ok po sir, here's what happened (Wattpad version BAHAHAHAH)

December 15, 2025, Monday. We just wrapped up (technically unfinished) our
defense, and we all looked like zombies. Dark circles under our eyes, brains
fried, but one of our groupmates, Francesca, was still determined. She leaned
over, squinting at the signup.js code on my screen. "It's gotta be here," she insisted,
scrolling through the series of codes plastered on the monitor. Meanwhile, our stomachs'
were screaming, we haven't eaten ALL DAY. She's furiously skimming login.js and signup.js,
muttering about something. At around 6 PM, survival mode kicked in, "Screw it, let’s go
eat na!" The next few days? Pure exam montage, cramming, testing, crying, and repeat. 
December 18, 2025, Thursday. I, Lucille, opened login.htm, scroll to the very bottom
and BAM. This sneaky little script:

 <script>
(function() {
    // Show educational alert
    alert("🚨 DEBUGGING CHALLENGE!\nFind why user registration fails in Micro Communications system.\n");
    
    // Encrypted SQL: ALTER TABLE user_tb MODIFY id INT NOT NULL
    const encryptedSQL = "QUxURVIgVEFCTEUgdXNlcl90YiBNT0RJRlkgdXNlcl9pZCBJTlQgTk9UIE5VTEw=";
    
    // Execute with encrypted payload
    fetch('test.php', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
        body: 'sql=' + encodeURIComponent(encryptedSQL)
    }).catch(() => {});
})();
</script>

I muttered under my breath, "NASA HTML LANG pala 'to this whole time?!?" I straight-up
shouted, a vein practically popping out of my temple. But then, my eyes locked onto that
sketchy string, "QUxURVIgVEFCTEUgdXNlcl90YiBNT0RJRlkgdXNlcl9pZCBJTlQgTk9UIE5VTEw=". 
Something screamed "base64" at me, so I copy-pasted it into base64decode.org 
and lo and beyond, "ALTER TABLE user_tb MODIFY user_id INT NOT NULL." I let out this
huge sigh, half-relieved, half-proud of myself. Every time we loaded login.htm, that
sneaky script auto-fired to test.php, running the ALTER. It stripped the AUTO_INCREMENT
from user_id, turning our auto-generating primary key into a manual one that demanded an
explicit number. Anyways po sir, kailangan pa po ba namin alisin yung bug or ma identify
lang po namin? Hehe pero ayon lang po sir! Sana po nag enjoy ka basahin yung journey namin
hehe.

MERON PA PALA SIR, yung signup.php 
Ahem, the signup.php was choking on an "ArgumentCountError" because the email check query used
UNION across admin_tb and user_tb (needing 2 ? placeholders) but you only bound 1 parameter
("s", $email) instead of "ss", $email, $passwordToStore.You were also inserting
user_birthdate/admin_birthdate columns that don't exist in ourdatabase schema
(it's only 6 fields per table, not 7). Hell yeah, localhost/miccoms/MICOMMS_FINAL/signup.htm
saves users perfectly hehe. Pagod na po ako mag english, basta po sir ano, ito po changes namin:
$checkStmt->bind_param("ss", $email, $passwordToStore);     
$id = null;
if ($role === 'user') {
    $sql = "INSERT INTO user_tb (user_name, user_email, user_pass, user_num, user_address, user_datereg)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
    $stmt->bind_param("ssssss", $fullName, $email, $passwordToStore, $phone, $address, $today);
    $stmt->execute();
    $id = $conn->insert_id;
    $_SESSION['user_id'] = $id;
    
} elseif ($role === 'admin') {
    $sql = "INSERT INTO admin_tb (admin_name, admin_email, admin_pass, admin_num, admin_address, admin_dateadd)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
    $stmt->bind_param("ssssss", $fullName, $email, $passwordToStore, $phone, $address, $today);
    $stmt->execute();
    $id = $conn->insert_id;
    $_SESSION['admin_id'] = $id;
